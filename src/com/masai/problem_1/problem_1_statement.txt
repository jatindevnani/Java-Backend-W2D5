Abstract class assignment:
Create an abstract Java class with the name Animal.
Inside this class define following 3 methods
1. public abstract void makeNoise();
2. public void eat(){
System.out.println("Animal is eating");
}
3. public void walk(){
System.out.println("Animal is walking");
}
Create 3 child classes for the above Animal class :
1. Dog
2. Cat
3. Tiger
Override makeNoise method in all these child classes as follows:
1. Inside Dog:
System.out.println("Barking...");
2. Inside Cat:
System.out.println("Meaw...");
3. Inside Tiger:
System.out.println("Raoring...");
Abstract class assignment: 2
Create the Main class as follows and implement the commented line
class Main{
public static void main(String[] args){
//create an array of Animal class with size 3
//initialize all 3 elements of this Animal class with Dog, Cat and Tiger class object.
//call the all methods (eat,walk,makeNoise) from all the 3 objects.
}
